# Aevol-Effective-Population
Code used to perform post-processing on Aevol data files to predict the Effective Population size of in-silico populations. 


I developed this code during my Research Internship at the INRIA-Beagle team, while working on the Aevol project (http://www.aevol.fr/). I also developed files in C++ 
within the Aevol platform that calculated the Coalescence times for a population at every generation, and calculated the Muller strains to be outputted.
